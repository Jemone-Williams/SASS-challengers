    <p class="paragraph">From the time I signed up everyone I’ve been in contact with was helpful and friendly.
      CodeSpace is a very good platform to establish your programming journey! I’ve never seen such talented and highly equipped tutors on the programming world.</p>
<p class="paragraph">learning HTML and CSS I've found has given me a much better understanding of websites in general and how they work. Learning HTML and CSS may have been one of the easiest things ever for me to learn because i believe if you have a desire to learn something you can very easily grasp it. After reading a book based on coding i decided to move on to more interactive learning experience. And CodeSpace was perfect for this.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Once I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS I knew that the best way to put my skills to the test was to actually make websites from scratch. It's easy editing existing code but creating something from scratch is like some sort of ritual when it comes to learning web design - it's just a good way to test yourself.
Knowing HTML and CSS is an absolutely brilliant skill to have nowadays due to how much we use the internet. Afterwards, other coding languages come pretty easy, it's like having an epiphany - you just seem to get how code works.
